# Open Source Coding (Introduction) (OPSC7311)
This repository contains the example code for OPSC7311 (Kotlin edition).

Each Learning Unit has its own folder.

For the sample app in Learning Unit 5, you need to:

1. Sign up for a Firebase account if you don't have one yet.
2. Create a new project using the Firebase console at https://console.firebase.google.com/
3. Connect the app to the project using Android Studio.

Read Learning Unit 5 Sections 3 and 4 of the Module Manual for more information. Make sure you follow the instructions for the correct type of database - Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore.
